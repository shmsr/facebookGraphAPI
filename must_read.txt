These are the problems I've faced:

Graph API is really complex to use. At some time it's working and after some, it just doesn't work a damn.

1) Error using HTTP protocol = Use HTTPS (Enforce HTTPS is enabled on Facebook APP). If you don't, you won't be able to log in.
2) Don't run it locally = Use ngrok/ some service to get a HTTPS deployed link for your locally deployed mode setup
3) Whitelist the HTTPS domain by adding it to "App Domains" in Facebook App
4) If using python, there's no tutorial related to Facebook. Tutorials available are many years old and Graph API has changed signicantly and even the policy's are changed a lot
5) Not many resourced for Python for using Facebook-SDK
6) Rather Javascript or Java is preferred, from what I saw.
7) Add the domain and webhook to "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" as "Use Strict Mode for Redirect URIs" is enabled
8) User's token and Page's token are different, remember. So, both's graph will work different ways.
9) Access tokens do expire. Facebook's page token expires after 2 hours. One is that generate a longer lasting one. Or change the token periodically
10) I have generated one longer lasting token valid till July 5, 2019
11) GRAPH API's put_object won't work as permission are not given. We are only allowed to post some status only if we have valid permission.
12) For it's permission App Review must be done
13) For that "Privacy Policies" and "T&C" required
14) Database is SQLite along with ORM is SQLAlchemy
15) We have two tables, one of "users" and one of "posts"

+ If any bug found, report me
+ If any modification, or anything more needed to done, notify me.
+ If there's problem in setting up the application, do bug me.
+ If required credentials such as keys, tokens; do bug me.

Thanks,
